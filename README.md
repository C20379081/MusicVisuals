# Description of the assignment
We built this project together through in person and online collabrative sessions, which has led to the final product that we are all proud of. This assignment is based on Nazar the evil eye. We decided to have an interactive face as the centre piece and the eyes presenting an element of hypnosis on the user. All the elements of our visualisation are perfectly symmetrical which is a key aspect to the visual beauty of the project, this appealing nature was an aspect we wanted to hone in on.
Overall we are very pleased with the outcome and we feel we have learnt many new skills and now have a proficient understanding of java processing and git.
